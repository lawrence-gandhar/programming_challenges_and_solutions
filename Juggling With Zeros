Juggling With Zeros

Challenge Description:

In this challenge, you will deal with zero-based numbers. A zero-based number has the following form: "flag" "sequence of zeroes" "flag" "sequence of zeroes", and so on. The numbers are separated by a single space.

00 0 0 00 00 0

You have to convert zero-based numbers into integers. To do this, you need to perform the following steps:

    Convert a zero-based number into a binary form using the following rules:

    a) flag "0" means that the following sequence of zeroes should be appended to a binary string.

    b) flag "00" means that the following sequence of zeroes should be transformed into a sequence of ones and be appended to a binary string.

    00 0 0 00 00 0 --> 1001

    Convert the obtained binary string into an integer.

    1001 --> 9
